Nick Sax awakes on a hospital gurney. He's a hit man, used to be a cop; it's all part of the job. What's troubling Sax isn't his serious injury, it's the seriously perky flying blue horse. That claims it is the imaginary friend of someone in serious trouble. The horse's name? Happy, of course. Adapted from a Grant Morrison story.
