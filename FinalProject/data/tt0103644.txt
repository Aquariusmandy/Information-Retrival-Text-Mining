After escaping with Newt and Hicks from the moon LB-426, Ellen Ripley crash-lands on Fiorina 161, a prison planet and home to a correctional facility. Unfortunately, although Newt and Hicks did not survive the crash, a more unwelcome visitor does. The prison does not allow weapons of any kind, and with help being a long time away, the prisoners must simply survive in any way they can. When help does arrive, the true intentions of the Company becomes clear. While living on the prison planet until she is rescued by her employers, Ripley discovers the horrifying reason for her crash: An alien stowaway. As the alien matures and begins killing off the prisoners, Ripley is unaware that her true enemy is more than just the killer alien.
