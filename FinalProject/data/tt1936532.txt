This "Closer" spinoff follows cases handled by the Major Crimes division of the LA Police Department. The 7-member team is headed by Capt. Sharon Raydor, whose intellectual smarts combined with a calm, even temperament help a team of experts solve high-profile murder cases. In addition to running the show, Raydor helps guide and protect her teenage charge, a witness in a horrific crime, who finds a safe refuge among members of the major-case squad.
